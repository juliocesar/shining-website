      <p>A toolkit for creating in-browser presentations.</p>

      <h1>Quickstart</h1>
      <p>Install via <a href="http://rubygems.org/">rubygems</a>:</p>
      <code>$ sudo gem install shining</code>

      <h1>Intro</h1>
      <p>
        Shining helps you creating presentations that you present from a web browser. The presentations
        that it generates are entirely based in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, with a little help from CSS
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-2d-transforms/">transforms</a> and
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-transitions/">transitions</a>, and <a href="jquery.com">jQuery</a>.
      </p>

    <section id="composed">
      <h1>What makes a presentation?</h1>
      <p>
        A presentation is composed of:
        <ul>
          <li>A configuration file named <em>config.json</em>.</li>
          <li>Slides, which are plain HTML files in the slides folder.</li>
          <li>
            An index file named <em>index.html</em> in the root presentation folder, which is where you
            start a presentation.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="configuration">
      <h1>Configuration</h1>
      <p>
        Presentation-wide configuration happens in the <em>config.json</em> file, which as you probably
        guessed, it's a plain text file containing <a href="http://www.jsonlint.com/">valid JSON</a>. It's
        important that it should be valid (e.g.: no single quotes) as otherwise it won't be parsed at all. 
        Valid parameters:
        <ul>
          <li>
            slides: an array containing the name of the presentation's slides. If you're using the generator
            to add slides, don't worry about editing it.
          </li>
          <li>
            transitions: a string corresponding to one of the <a href="#">available transition effects</a>, 
            or <em>false</em> disables them altogether.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="slides">
      <h1>Slides</h1>
      <p>Easy way first. Change the directory to the presentation's directory first. Then:</p>
      <code>$ shine slide mynewslide</code>
      <p>
        Where "mynewslide" is the name of the slide. This will create a slide in <em>ROOT/slides/mynewslide.html</em>, 
        and a <a href="#">slide script</a> in <em>ROOT/slides/mynewslide.js</em>. It will also automagically edit the 
        <em>config.json</em> file for you, adding a reference to the newly added slide.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also create slides manually by adding an HTML file to <em>ROOT/slides</em>, and then adding the file name 
        (minus the extension) to <em>config.json</em>. Though really, just use the damn generator.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="templates">
      <h1>Slide templates</h1>
      <p>
        Shining supports <a href="http://haml-lang.com/">Haml</a> or 
        <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> templates for creating slides. Before you
        can use them though, you need to compile the templates into HTML by running a command.
      </p>
      <p>To generate a Haml template, in a presentation folder type:</p>
      <code>$ shine slide myslide haml</code>
      <p>Conversely, a Markdown template can be generated by the same command, except use "markdown" instead of "haml".</p>
      <p>Once you're done editing the template, compile by:</p>
      <code>$ shine compile</code>
    </section>
    <section id="scripts">
      <h1>Slide scripts</h1>
      <p>
        Slides can have an associated script which you can use to trigger certain actions (e.g.: effects) at a predetermined 
        time. If you used the generator to create a slide, you'll notice a .js file got created along with it. That's the script 
        we're talking about. So for instance, say you have 2 hidden paragraphs in your slide, and you intent to show one after 
        another. Open that .js file and do:
      </p>
      <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: js; gutter: false">
      1, $('p:first').effect('fades-in')
      3, $('p:eq(1)').effect('fades-in')
      </script>
      <p>In a nutshell, the syntax of the file is:</p>
      <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: plain; gutter: false">
      (time), (javascript)
      </script>
      <p>It's possible to have Javascript spanning throughout multiple lines as well, such as for instance</p>
      <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: js; gutter: false">
      1, 
          console.log('this happens 1 second into')
          console.log('and so does this')
      2,  console.log('whereas this happens on second 2')
      4,
          alert('rise and shine!')
      </script>      
      <p>This is handy if you want to schedule things you'd like to see happening at certain stages during a presentation.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="vendor">
      <h1>Deploying</h1>
      <p>
        If at some stage you wish to publish the presentation on <a href="http://drunkenachura.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/internet-serious-business.jpg">the internet</a> perhaps, or
        it's best if you <em>vendor</em> all the dependencies first. This will ensure all the necessary libraries required
        to play your presentation are included. In a gist, you're making your presentation self-contained.
      </p>
      <p>In the presentation's directory, run the command:</p>
      <code>$ shine vendor</code>
      <p>Then put this folder somewhere accessible via the web, point your browser to it, and you're set.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="effects">
      <h1>Effects</h1>
      <p>
        Effects are applied on elements by adding CSS classes to them. Effects are based on CSS transitions and/or transforms.
        What this means is they're likely to work on top notch engines such as <a href="http://webkit.org/">Webkit</a>, they
        <em>may</em> work on <a href="getfirefox.com">Firefox</a>, and most likely <em>will not</em> work with Internet Explorer.
      </p>
      <p>
        That may or may not change in the near future. For now, stick to using decent web browsers when presenting, and perhaps
        relying more on content rather than presentation ;-)
