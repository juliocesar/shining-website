      <p>A toolkit for creating in-browser presentations.</p>
    </header>
    <section id="example">
      <h1>Example</h1>
      <p>A <a href="example/index.html">quick example</a> of a presentation using the default theme with fade transitions.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="quickstart">
      <h1>Quickstart</h1>
      <p>Install via <a href="http://rubygems.org/">rubygems</a>:</p>
      <code>$ sudo gem install shining</code>
      <p>Creating a new presentation:</p>
      <code>$ shine mypresentationdir</code>
      <p>Shining will then copy all necessary files to run a presentation to it's directory.</p>
      <p>
        You can run a presentation locally by opening the <em>index.html</em> file in the presentation's root
        directory, or run (port number can be whatever number of your choosing):
      </p>
      <code>
        $ rackup -p 4567
      </code>
      <p>
        and then point your browser to <em>http://localhost:4567</em>. <strong>NOTE:</strong> Google Chrome won't allow
        you to play a presentation locally ever thanks to Javascript security restrictions. So if you're planning on
        using Chrome, always take the rackup route.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, in order for the rackup command to be available, make sure you have the 
        <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/rack">Rack ruby gem</a> installed. To the best of my knowledge, any version
        upwards of 0.9 will do the job.
      </p>

    <section id="intro">
      <h1>Intro</h1>
      <p>
        Shining helps you creating presentations that you can view from a web browser. The presentations
        that it generates are entirely based in HTML, CSS, with a little help from CSS
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-2d-transforms/">transforms</a>,
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-transitions/">transitions</a>, and <a href="jquery.com">jQuery</a>.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="composed">
      <h1>What makes a presentation?</h1>
      <p>
        A presentation is composed of:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A configuration file named <em>config.json</em>.</li>
        <li>Slides, which are plain HTML files in the slides folder.</li>
        <li>
          An index file named <em>index.html</em> in the root presentation folder, which is where you
          start a presentation from.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="configuration">
      <h1>Configuration</h1>
      <p>
        Presentation-wide configuration happens in the <em>config.json</em> file, which is a plain text file  
        containing an object in <a href="http://www.jsonlint.com/">valid JSON</a>.
        It's important that it's valid (e.g.: no single quotes) as otherwise your presentation won't even 
        start. Valid attributes are:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>slides</dt>
        <dd>an array containing the name of the presentation's slides. If you're using the generator
        to add slides, don't worry about editing it.</dd>
        <dt>transitions</dt>
        <dd>a string corresponding to one of the <a href="#transitions">available transition 
        effects</a>, or <em>false</em> disables them altogether.</dd>
        <dt>plugins</dt>
        <dd>a list of <a href="#plugins">plugins</a> that will be used with your presentation. By 
        default, the <em>resize</em> and <em>syntaxhighlighter</em> plugins will get loaded, allowing for 
        automatic font resizing based on screen dimensions and code syntax highlighting, respectively.</dd>
        <dt>help</dt>
        <dd>boolean. <em>false</em> disables the growl-like messages that appear on the top right hand
        corner of the screen.</dd>
      </dl>
    </section>
    <section id="slides">
      <h1>Slides</h1>
      <p>Easy way first. Change the directory to the presentation's directory first. Then:</p>
      <code>$ shine slide mynewslide</code>
      <p>
        Where "mynewslide" is the name of the slide. This will create a slide in <em>ROOT/slides/mynewslide.html</em>,
        and a <a href="#">slide script</a> in <em>ROOT/slides/mynewslide.js</em>. It will also automagically edit the
        <em>config.json</em> file for you, adding a reference to the newly added slide.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also create slides manually by adding an HTML file to <em>ROOT/slides</em>, and then adding the file name
        (minus the extension) to <em>config.json</em>. Though really, just use the damn generator.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="templates">
      <h1>Slide templates</h1>
      <p>
        Shining supports <a href="http://haml-lang.com/">Haml</a> or
        <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> templates for creating slides. 
        Before you can use them though, you need to compile the templates into HTML by running a command.
      </p>
      <p>To generate a Haml template, in a presentation folder type:</p>
      <code>$ shine slide myslide haml</code>
      <p>Conversely, a Markdown template can be generated by the same command, except use "markdown" instead of "haml".</p>
      <p>Once you're done editing the template, compile by:</p>
      <code>$ shine compile</code>
    </section>
    <section id="scripts">
      <h1>Slide scripts</h1>
      <p>
        Slides can have an associated script which you can use to trigger certain actions (e.g.: effects) at a 
        predetermined time. If you used the generator to create a slide, you'll notice a .js file got created 
        along with it. That's the script we're talking about. So for instance, say you have 2 hidden paragraphs 
        in your slide, and you intent to show one after another. Open that .js file and write:
      </p>
      <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: js; gutter: false">
      1, $('p:first').effect('fades-in')
      3, $('p:eq(1)').effect('fades-in')
      </script>
      <p>In a nutshell, the syntax of the file is:</p>
      <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: plain; gutter: false">
      (time), (javascript)
      </script>
      <p>It's possible to have Javascript spanning throughout multiple lines as well, such as for instance</p>
      <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: js; gutter: false">
      1,
          console.log('this happens 1 second into')
          console.log('and so does this')
      2,  console.log('whereas this happens on second 2')
      4,
          alert('rise and shine!')
      </script>
      <p>This is handy if you want to schedule things you'd like to see happening at certain stages during a presentation.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="styles">
      <h1>Individual slide styles</h1>
      <p>
        If a corresponding CSS file exists, it will take effect for as long as a particular slide is loaded. 
        For example, if you have a slide named "intro", having a file <em>intro.css</em> in the 
        <em>slides/</em> folder will make sure it gets loaded along.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="navigating">
      <h1>Navigating</h1>
      <p>
        You can navigate forward by pressing the <em>space key</em>, or the keyboard right arrow. Left arrow 
        navigates to the previous slide.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="transitions">
      <h1>Transitions</h1>
      <p>
        Transitions kick in as you switch from one slide to another. Available transitions are:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>fade</dt>
        <dd>Fades slides in/out.</dd>
        <dt>slide</dt>
        <dd>Slides a slide to the left, next one comes from the right.</dd>
        <dt>slice</dt>
        <dd>Slices the slide out. This neat effect doesn't work too well with Internet
        Explorer, but it degrades nicely so it'll look like no transition effect is being used.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>If none is specified, slides will switch instantly.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="plugins">
      <h1>Plugins</h1>
      <p>
        Plugins enhance Shining's default functionalities. They consist simply of a Javascript file that 
        gets loaded according to the name specified in a presentation's configuration file (e.g.: 
        <em>resize</em> loads <em>lib/plugins/resize.js</em>).
      </p>
      <p>Currently available plugins are:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>resize</dt>
        <dd>automatic font sizing according to available screen dimensions.</dd>
        <dt>syntaxhighlighter</dt>
        <dd>
          Adds <a href="http://alexgorbatchev.com/wiki/SyntaxHighlighter">SyntaxHighlighter</a> support. Refer
          to documentation available on the original website for examples.
        </dd>
        <dt>iphone</dt>
        <dd>Makes your presentation look nice, and behave well when viewed on an iPhone.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Though you can write the scripts in any way you want, Shining itself publishes certain events, as
        in Javascript events, which exist among other reasons for plugins to be able to interfere with
        the natural order of things without needing to intertwine with Shining's code directly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently the following events are available:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>next</dt>
        <dd>as the user requests the next slide.</dd>
        <dt>previous</dt>
        <dd>as the user requests the previous slide.</dd>
        <dt>initialize</dt>
        <dd>when the presentation starts.</dd>
        <dt>slideplay</dt>
        <dd>when a slide plays, after the contents of the slide are loaded
        onto the stage.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        To make things more readable, a method is provided for you to access these events. For instance:
      </p>
      <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: js; gutter: false">
        Shining.when('slideplay', function() {
          alert("Of course, you wouldn't really do that")
        })
      </script>
      <p>
        Check the <em>lib/plugins</em> directory for a few more examples.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="heroku">
      <h1>Deploying to Heroku</h1>
      <p>
        Deploying a Shining presentation to Heroku allows you to quickly host a presentation online. This can 
        be handy if for any reason you don't have a web server handy to host it.
      </p>
      <p>In a presentation's directory, run:</p>
      <code>
        $ shine deploy
      </code>
      <p>You'll see some console output going. What matters is the bit that says something like this:</p>
      <code>
        -----> Heroku receiving push<br />
        -----> Rack app detected<br />
               Compiled slug size is 68K<br />
        -----> Launching..... done<br />
               http://glowing-snow-39.heroku.com deployed to Heroku
      </code>
      <p>In the case above, the url <em>http://glowing-snow-39.heroku.com</em> is where you can find your presentation.</p>
