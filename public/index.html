  <section id="quickstart">
    <h1>Quick start</h1>
    <p>Install via <a href="http://rubygems.org">rubygems</a>:</p>
    <code>
      $ sudo gem install shining
    </code>
    <p>Creating a new presentation:</p>
    <code>
      $ shine mypresentationdir
    </code>
    <p>
      Shining will then copy all necessary files to run a presentation to the <em>mypresentationdir</em> directory.
      To run the presentation, from inside the presentation's directory, run:
    </p>
    <code>
      $ shine go
    </code>
    <p>To view it, point your browser to <em>http://localhost:4567</em>.</p>
    <p>BONUS: Host it on <a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a> by running:</p>
    <code>
      $ shine deploy
    </code>
    <p>Win!</p>
  </section>
  <section id="long-story">
    <h1>The long story</h1>
    <p>
      Shining consists of a generator, the command <em>shine</em>, and a basic set of JavaScripts and CSS. That
      alone will give you a working system for creating and showing slides from inside a web browser. 
      From there, you can use  a <a href="#themes">theme</a> (the default theme is there by, err, default), customize it, 
      or even modify Shining so it does what you'd like.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shining also features brain-dead easy deployments to <a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a>, so you can 
      host your presentations as an application for free, provided you have an account.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="structure">
    <h1>Structure</h1>
    <p>A presentation is composed of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A configuration file named <em>config.json</em>.</li>
      <li>
        Slides, which sit in the <em>slides</em> folder and can be either written straight in HTML 
        or <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>.
      </li>
      <li>An index file named <em>index.html</em>, where you start a presentation from.</li>
      <li>
        A <em>vendor</em> folder, which contains the necessary JavaScript and CSS files to
        run a presentation.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section id="configuration">
    <h1>Configuration</h1>
    <p>
      The presentation's config file is a valid JSON file that looks 
      <a href="http://github.com/juliocesar/shining/blob/master/templates/config.json">like this</a>.
      The following attributes and values are valid:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>slides</dt>
      <dd>An array containing the file names of the presentation's slides. If you're using the generator to add slides, don't worry about editing it.</dd>
      <dt>transitions</dt>
      <dd>
        A string corresponding to one of the <a href="#transitions">available transition effects</a>, or <em>false</em> disables transitions altogether.
      </dd>
      <dt>plugins</dt>
      <dd>
        A list of plugins that will be used. By default, the <a href="#plugins">resize</a> and <a href="#plugins">iphone</a> plugins will get loaded.
      </dd>
      <dt>title</dt>
      <dd>A title for the presentation.</dd>
      <dt>help</dt>
      <dd>Boolean. <em>false</em> disables the <a href="http://growl.info/">Growl</a>-like messages that appear on the top right hand corner of the screen.</dd>
      <dt>theme</dt>
      <dd>
        The theme used for the presentation. Currently shine features 2 themes: default (dark, and centered) and slidedown (predominantly white, aligned
        to the left). Omitting this value applies the default theme.
      </dd>
    </dl>
  </section>
  <section id="slides">
    <h1>Slides</h1>
    <p>Change the directory to the presentation's directory, then run:</p>
    <code>
      $ shine slide mynewslide
    </code>
    <p>
      Where <em>mynewslide</em> is the name of the slide. A new slide will be created in <em>slides/mynewslide.html</em>. This will also
      automatically updated the <em>config.json</em> file, adding a reference to the new slide.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also create slides manually by adding an HTML file to <em>slides</em>, and then adding the file name to <em>config.json</em>. 
      Though really, just use the damn generator. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Shining supports <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> apart from HTML. To create a new slide using
      Markdown, run the same command as above, passing "markdown" as a parameter, like so:
    </p>
    <code>
      $ shine slide mynewslide markdown
    </code>
  </section>
  <section id="steps">
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <p>
      You may want to progressively show the contents of a slide. Shining addresses that
      as "steps". A step is, by default, hidden. Trying to advance to the next slide
      will show the next step in the order the slide is written. That is, it follows the order 
      in the DOM.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any element can be a step. Just add a CSS class named <em>step</em> to it and you're set.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="notes">
    <h1>Notes</h1>
    <p>
      Content that is tangential, though related, to the point presented in a slide can be
      added to it as a note. That is appropriate, say, for adding links which you believe
      might help reinforcing the argument being presented
    </p>
    <p>
      To add a note to a slide, you need to add a <em>&lt;aside&gt;</em> tag. The contents
      of this tag will be shown in a balloon at the bottom right hand corner of the screen.
    </p>
    <p>Like so:</p>
    <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: xml"><![CDATA[
      <h1>My slide</h1>
      <p>Something important.</p>
      <aside>And this is a <a href="#">useless link</a></aside>
    ]]></script>    
  </section>
  <section id="slide-scripts">
    <h1>Slide scripts</h1>
    <p>
      Slides can have an associated script which you can use to trigger certain actions (for example: effects, hiding or showing things) at
      a predetermined point in time from when a slide plays. Slide scripts are kept in the <em>slide/</em> directory along with the actual
      slides, and have the same file name, except that the extension should be <em>.js</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      So assuming we have a slide named <em>mynewslide.html</em> sitting in the <em>slides</em> folder, to create a slide script for it,
      create a file named <em>mynewslide.js</em> in that same folder. Put this in:
    </p>    
    <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: js">
      2,  alert("alert at 2 seconds")
      8,  alert("alert again at 8 seconds")
    </script>
    <p>
      Not particularly useful, but what this script does it it schedules 2 alerts: one will fire 2 seconds after the slide appeared,
      and the second alert will be fired at 8 seconds. This should give you an idea of the syntax for slide scripts.
    </p>
    <p>You can also pass multiple instructions to a single instant in multiple lines, like this:</p>
    <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: js">
      3,  console.log('first')
          console.log('second')
      5,  console.log('last')
    </script>
  </section>
  <section id="slide-styles">
    <h1>Slide stylesheets</h1>
    <p>
      Like slide scripts, creating a file with the same name as a slide, but using a <em>.css</em> file extension (following the previous
      example, it would be <em>mynewslide.css</em>), will ensure that the stylesheets gets included in the page as that slide loads. 
      This is handy for when you want a set of rules to only apply when a certain slide plays.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="transitions">
    <h1>Transitions</h1>
    <p>
      Transitions kick in as you switch from one slide to another. Available transitions are:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>fade</dt>
      <dd>Fade slides in and out.</dd>
      <dt>slide</dt>
      <dd>Slides a slide to the left, next one comes from the right.</dd>
    </dl>    
  </section>
  <section id="plugins">
    <h1>Plugins</h1>
    <p>
      Plugins help Shining go a bit further by adding to the core set of functionalities. They consist simply of a Javascript file that 
      gets loaded according to the name specified in a presentation's configuration file (e.g.: <em>resize</em> loads 
      <em>plugins/resize.js</em>). 
    </p>
    <p>Plugins available by default:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>resize</dt>
      <dd>Automatic font sizing according to available screen dimensions.</dd>
      <dt>iphone</dt>
      <dd>
        BETA: Adds iPhone and iPad support to a presentation. Transitions are disabled, in favor of touch and slide
        based navigation. <a href="#steps">Steps</a> are also shown by default for obvious reasons.
      </dd>
    </dl>
  </section>
  <section id="themes">
    <h1>Themes</h1>
    <p>
      Shining comes with 2 themes: <em>default</em> and <em>slidedown</em> (vaguely mimics
      the looks of <a href="http://nakajima.github.com/slidedown/#0">slidedown</a>, another HTML
      presentation framework).
    </p>
    <p>
      You can find examples of both by clicking the slider at the top of this page. The one
      that's predominantly white is <em>slidedown</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A third custom theme named <em>rain</em> was built specifically for my presentation on
      <a href="http://css-progressive-enhancement.heroku.com">CSS Progressive Enhancement</a>,
      at <a href="http://rubyonrails.com.au/">RORO Sydney</a> on September 2010. It suits
      as a good example of how easy it is to build a custom theme for Shining. Source
      for it can be found <a href="http://github.com/juliocesar/css-progressive-enhancement/blob/master/vendor/themes/rain.css">here</a>.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="heroku">
    <h1>Deploying to Heroku</h1>
    <p>
      Deploying a Shining presentation to Heroku allows you to quickly host a presentation online. This can be handy if for any reason you 
      don't have a web server handy to host it.
    </p>
    <p>In a presentation's directory, run:</p>
    <code>
      $ shine deploy
    </code>
    <p>
      Shining will create a URL friendly name based on the name of your presentation. You can override that by passing an argument to be used 
      as the app name, as in:
    </p>
    <code>
      $ shine deploy "peanut butter jelly time" 
    </code>
    <p>Check the console output for the URL where your presentation is hosted.</p>
