      <h1>Quickstart</h1>
      <p>Install via <a href="http://rubygems.org/">rubygems</a>:</p>
      <code>$ sudo gem install shining</code>
      <p>Create a new presentation:</p>

      <h1>Intro</h1>
      <p>
        Shining helps you creating presentations that you present from a web browser. The presentations
        that it generates are entirely based in HTML, CSS, with a little help from CSS
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-2d-transforms/">transforms</a> and
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-transitions/">transitions</a>, and <a href="jquery.com">jQuery</a>.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="composed">
      <h1>What makes a presentation?</h1>
      <p>
        A presentation is composed of:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A configuration file named <em>config.json</em>.</li>
        <li>Slides, which are plain HTML files in the slides folder.</li>
        <li>
          An index file named <em>index.html</em> in the root presentation folder, which is where you
          start a presentation from.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="example">
      <h1>Example</h1>
      <p>
        An example can be <a href="example/index.html">found here</a>.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="configuration">
      <h1>Configuration</h1>
      <p>
        Presentation-wide configuration happens in the <em>config.json</em> file, which as you probably
        guessed, it's a plain text file containing an object in <a href="http://www.jsonlint.com/">valid JSON</a>.
        It's important that it's valid (e.g.: no single quotes) as otherwise your presentation won't even start.
        Valid attributes are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          slides: an array containing the name of the presentation's slides. If you're using the generator
          to add slides, don't worry about editing it.
        </li>
        <li>
          transitions: a string corresponding to one of the <a href="#">available transition effects</a>,
          or <em>false</em> disables them altogether.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="slides">
      <h1>Slides</h1>
      <p>Easy way first. Change the directory to the presentation's directory first. Then:</p>
      <code>$ shine slide mynewslide</code>
      <p>
        Where "mynewslide" is the name of the slide. This will create a slide in <em>ROOT/slides/mynewslide.html</em>,
        and a <a href="#">slide script</a> in <em>ROOT/slides/mynewslide.js</em>. It will also automagically edit the
        <em>config.json</em> file for you, adding a reference to the newly added slide.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also create slides manually by adding an HTML file to <em>ROOT/slides</em>, and then adding the file name
        (minus the extension) to <em>config.json</em>. Though really, just use the damn generator.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="templates">
      <h1>Slide templates</h1>
      <p>
        Shining supports <a href="http://haml-lang.com/">Haml</a> or
        <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> templates for creating slides. Before you
        can use them though, you need to compile the templates into HTML by running a command.
      </p>
      <p>To generate a Haml template, in a presentation folder type:</p>
      <code>$ shine slide myslide haml</code>
      <p>Conversely, a Markdown template can be generated by the same command, except use "markdown" instead of "haml".</p>
      <p>Once you're done editing the template, compile by:</p>
      <code>$ shine compile</code>
    </section>
    <section id="scripts">
      <h1>Slide scripts</h1>
      <p>
        Slides can have an associated script which you can use to trigger certain actions (e.g.: effects) at a predetermined
        time. If you used the generator to create a slide, you'll notice a .js file got created along with it. That's the script
        we're talking about. So for instance, say you have 2 hidden paragraphs in your slide, and you intent to show one after
        another. Open that .js file and do:
      </p>
      <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: js; gutter: false">
      1, $('p:first').effect('fades-in')
      3, $('p:eq(1)').effect('fades-in')
      </script>
      <p>In a nutshell, the syntax of the file is:</p>
      <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: plain; gutter: false">
      (time), (javascript)
      </script>
      <p>It's possible to have Javascript spanning throughout multiple lines as well, such as for instance</p>
      <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: js; gutter: false">
      1,
          console.log('this happens 1 second into')
          console.log('and so does this')
      2,  console.log('whereas this happens on second 2')
      4,
          alert('rise and shine!')
      </script>
      <p>This is handy if you want to schedule things you'd like to see happening at certain stages during a presentation.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="styles">
      <h1>Individual slide styles</h1>
      <p>
        If a corresponding CSS file exists, it will take effect for as long as a particular slide is loaded. For example, if
        you have a slide named "intro", having a file <em>intro.css</em> in the <em>slides/</em> folder will make sure it
        gets loaded along.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="navigating">
      <h1>Navigating</h1>
      <p>
        You can navigate forward by pressing the <em>space key</em>. Navigation controls appear when you move the mouse near the
        bottom of the screen.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="vendor">
      <h1>Deploying</h1>
      <p>
        If at some stage you wish to publish the presentation on <a href="http://drunkenachura.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/internet-serious-business.jpg">the internet</a> perhaps, or
        it's best if you <em>vendor</em> all the dependencies first. This will ensure all the necessary libraries required
        to play your presentation are included. In a gist, you're making your presentation self-contained.
      </p>
      <p>In the presentation's directory, run the command:</p>
      <code>$ shine vendor</code>
      <p>Then put this folder somewhere accessible via the web, point your browser to it, and you're set.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="effects">
      <h1>How effects work</h1>
      <p>
        Effects are applied on elements by adding CSS classes to them. Effects are based on CSS transitions and/or transforms.
        What this means is they're likely to work on top notch engines such as <a href="http://webkit.org/">Webkit</a>, they
        <em>may</em> work on <a href="getfirefox.com">Firefox</a>, and most likely <em>will not</em> work with Internet Explorer.
      </p>
      <p>
        That may or may not change in the near future. For now, stick to using decent web browsers when presenting, and perhaps
        relying more on content rather than how it looks ;-)
      </p>
      <p>
        In general, you'll apply effects to an element in one of two circumstances: when you're editing a slide (in which case
        you'd put the appropriate CSS class on it), or through a slide script using Javascript. With the former, the effect
        will take place as soon as the slide gets shown, whereas the latter would happen whenever you programmed it to.
      </p>
      <p>So for example, in the code for a slide you could do:</p>
      <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: html; gutter: false">
      <h1 class="shines">This heading shines when the slide appears</h1>
      <p>Further text for the slide</p>
      </script>
      <p>Or from inside a slide script, if you'd like that same heading to shine, but 2 seconds into the slide running:</p>
      <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: js; gutter: false">
      2, $('h1:first').effect('shines')
      </script>      
    </section>
    <section id="effects-ref">
      <h1>Effects reference</h1>
      <p>
        These are the currently available effects you can use. These are straight CSS class names you can add to elements in
        order to apply the effect. Browser compatibility is outlined after the description.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>fades-in-zoom-slow</em>: Fades in, slowly zooming in at the same time. <span class="compat">webkit</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>fades-in-zoom-quick</em>: Fades in, quickly zooming in at the same time. <span class="compat">webkit</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>appears-dramatically</em>: Fades in, cinema style. <span class="compat">webkit</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>speeds-in-left</em>: Slides in from right to left, with a speed-like effect. <span class="compat">webkit</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>speeds-in-right</em>: Slides in from left to right, with a speed-like effect. <span class="compat">webkit</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>dances</em>: Looping dance effect. <span class="compat">webkit</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>y-spin</em>: Spins once in the vertically. <span class="compat">webkit</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>x-spin</em>: Spins once in the horizontally. <span class="compat">webkit</span>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> The sheer amount of Webkit-only effects is so because right Shining had originally being
        conceived to work exclusively on Webkit. I'm progressing it towards engine independence. Also, note that by Webkit
        I actually mean Safari or Google Chrome, and potentially the <a href="http://nightly.webkit.org/">nightly builds</a>
        available from webkit.org. It's just shorter than explaining this everywhere I want to refer to
